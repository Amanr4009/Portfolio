            <h4>Full Stack Developer</h4>
            <p>Hello! I'm Aman Kumar, a dedicated individual with a passion for problem-solving and a deep-rooted love
                for technology. Currently based in Bangalore, India, I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in
                Computer Science and Engineering from MS Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences.
                My journey into the realm of technology commenced during my college, where I cultivated a robust
                foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and C. As I delved deeper into my studies, I
                delved into various facets of computer science, encompassing data structures, algorithms, machine
                learning, and artificial intelligence.Throughout my academic tenure, I actively engaged in projects that
                provided hands-on experience in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. From crafting
                web-based code editors to spearheading full-stack social networking applications, I've had the privilege
                to work with an array of technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and
                more.
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I've garnered invaluable industry exposure through internships,
                such as my stint at Habitat for Humanity. Here, I honed my skills in front-end and back-end development,
                alongside mastering database management systems.
                Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I'm constantly seeking ways to broaden my skill set
                and deepen my knowledge. My certifications in Full Stack Development and Front-End Development attest to
                my dedication to continuous learning.

                As I look ahead to the next phase of my journey, I'm brimming with anticipation to push the boundaries
                of technology further, unravel intricate problems, and make a tangible impact in the dynamic realm of
                software engineering.</p>
